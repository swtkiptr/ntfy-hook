## üåê Tutorial: How to Create an ntfy URL in ntfy.sh

`ntfy.sh` is a simple and powerful service for managing notification topics. Follow these steps to create an ntfy URL:

### Step 1: Choose a Topic
A "topic" is a unique identifier for your notifications. It acts like a channel where all your notifications will be sent. For example:
```
https://ntfy.sh/my-topic
```
Replace `my-topic` with a unique name (e.g., `alerts`, `device-notifications`, etc.).

### Step 2: Test Your ntfy Topic
Send a test notification to your topic using `curl`:
```bash
curl -d "Hello, ntfy!" https://ntfy.sh/my-topic
```
This will send a notification to the topic `my-topic`. You can replace the message content (`Hello, ntfy!`) with your desired notification text.

### Step 3: Subscribe to the Topic
Use the ntfy app or any compatible tool to subscribe to your topic:
1. Open the ntfy app or visit the ntfy.sh website.
2. Enter your topic URL (e.g., `https://ntfy.sh/my-topic`) to subscribe and start receiving notifications.

### Step 4: Secure Your Topic (Optional)
To make your topic private, you can use basic authentication. For example:
```bash
curl -u username:password -d "Secure message" https://ntfy.sh/my-private-topic
```
Replace `username` and `password` with your credentials and `my-private-topic` with your topic name.

### Step 5: Integrate With ntfy Hook
1. Open the ntfy Hook app on your Android device.
2. Enter your ntfy topic URL (e.g., `https://ntfy.sh/my-topic`) in the server URL field.
3. Configure other settings (e.g., select apps to forward).
4. Start the service and enjoy seamless notification forwarding!
